## Changelog ##
* v1.3.1 (2016-01-24)
    * Modify blockfeed logic to work with reorgs properly again with the undolog fix introduced in `counterparty-lib` 9.53.0.
    * Enhance blockfeed error recovery logic to make more robust and minimize/remove chance of blockfeed hangs.
    * `/_api` handler includes extra fields: `counterparty-server_caught_up` and improved reporting of error conditions.
* v1.3.0 (2015-10-31)
    * Fixes periodic `blockfeed` hanging issue (where `counterblock` would still run, but not process new blocks from `counterparty-server`)
    * Block processing is much more robust now if an exception is encountered (e.g. counterparty-server goes down). Should prevent additional hanging-type issues
    * Tweaked `blockfeed` "caught up" checking logic. Should be more reliable
    * Simplified `blockchain` module -- we call API methods on `counterparty-server` now, whereever possible, instead of reimplementing them on `counterblock`
    * Enhance the information returned with `GET /_api`. Several new parameters added, including `ERROR` for easier diagnosing of most common error conditions.
    * `GET /_api` now returns CORS headers, allowing it to be used with cross domain requests
    * Added this `ChangeLog.md` file
* v1.2.0 (2015-09-15)
    * Move most counterblock functionality into plug-in modules.
    * Pegs the pymongo library version, to avoid incompatibility issues with pymongo 3.0
    * Improves exception logging for exceptions that happen within a greenlet thread context
